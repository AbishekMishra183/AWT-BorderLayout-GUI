# AWT BorderLayout GUI

This repository contains a simple Java AWT application that demonstrates the use of the `BorderLayout` layout manager. The GUI includes two panels: a left panel with a button and a right panel with a label. When the button is pressed, the label's text is updated.

## Features
- **BorderLayout**: The main frame uses `BorderLayout` to organize components.
- **Interactive Panels**: The left panel contains a button, and the right panel contains a label.
- **Event Handling**: The label text in the right panel is updated when the button in the left panel is pressed
